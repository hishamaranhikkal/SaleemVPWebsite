and seal hermetically with a temporary cement. Devitalization is completed within
five to seven days. After devitalization, a permanent root canal filling can be placed
once the pulp is totally removed and pain relief is complete.</p>

Purified Water andAmorphous Silica.</p>
                            <h3>Indications</h3>
                            <p>: Used for conditioning both dental enamel and dentine surfaces prior to
the placement of an adhesive restoration.</p>
                            <h3>Instructions for Use</h3>
                            <p>: Clean the area to be etched, rinse and dry thoroughly. Place
the tip against the surface to be etched and slowly dispense the gel on the surface to
lay a fine line or paint a thin layer to the areas to be etched. Allow the gel to stay for 10-
15 seconds and rinse thoroughly with water spray. Dry etched tooth surface with
clean, dry air.</p>

                            <p>The product contains phosphoric acid. It can burn and cause irritation
to the tissues and therefore confine the use to areas to be etched. Fix the applicator tip
to the syringe and check the flow of gel before applying on the etching surface. Avoid
contact with eyes and prolonged contact with skin.</p>

cause irritation, burns of hypersensitivity. If contact with skin occurs immediately wipe
of thoroughly with cotton and alcohol and then wash well with soap and water. If skin
rash and sensitization or other allergic reaction occurs discontinue use and seek
medical attention. If the product comes into contact with the eyes, rinse thoroughly
with fresh water and consult a physician. It should not be used with patients who have
a history of severe allergic reaction to any of the components.</p>

chelates the calcium salts to facilitate endodontic instrument penetrations. Due to its
effervescent action with sodium hypochlorite solution, cleaning of root canal becomes very
easy. The use of sodium hypochlorite with the gel promotes internal bleaching of the tooth.

phosphate monomer, Silanated Barium Glass Powder Amorphous Fumed Silica,
coloring reagents, CuringAgents and Stabilizer.</p>
                            <h3>Indications</h3>
                            <p>1. Sealing/filling of pits and fissures. 2. Sealing/facing of damaged
enamel surfaces. 3. Covering of caries predilection sites during orthodontic
treatment. 4. Sealing of deciduous teeth.</p>
                            <h3>Method of use</h3>
                            <p>Fissures should be sealed as early as possible, as soon as the
eruption of the tooth allows treatment and moisture control is possible. After
isolating the operating site, thoroughly clean the surfaces to be sealed (rotating
brush/cleaning paste free of fluorides), spray and dry. In case of incipient carious
lesions or unclear diagnosis, extend the fissure with a fine instrument, if necessary.</p>
                            <h3>Application</h3>
                            <p>: Remove the protective cap from the syringe. Screw a new applicator
tip onto the PF Seal syringe. PF Seal flows homogeneously from the
applicator tip upon medium pressure and thus is very easy to dispense accurately.
Apply PF Seal from the margin into the fissure or cavity and allow it to penetrate
for 15 - 20 sec. Remove any air bubbles with the fine applicator tip.</p>
                            <h3>Light-curing</h3>
                            <p>: Pit and Fissure Seal for 40 sec per surface and check the sealing.
Conventional polymerisation devices are suitable for light curing this material. The
light output polymerisation devices should be above 800 mW/cm2. Remove excess
material cautiously (e.g. finishing diamond), polish if necessary (rubber polisher).
Then apply a FLUORODIP BIOACTIVE on the treated and neighbouring teeth.</p>
                            <h3>Caution</h3>
                            <p>Avoid contact of unpolymerized material with skin/mucous membrane or
eyes. Unpolymerized PF Seal may cause slight irritation and, in rare cases, may
lead to a sensitization against methacrylates. Commercial medical gloves do not
provide protection against the sensitizing effect of methacrylates.</p>
                            <h3>Warning</h3>
                            <p>Avoid prolonged or repeated contact with skin (allergic contact
dermatitis), and eyes. Avoid prolonged inhalation. Do not take internally. Contact
with the skin may cause irritation, burns of hypersensitivity. If contact with skin
occurs immediately wipe off thoroughly with cotton and alcohol and then wash well
with soap and water. If skin rash and sensitization or other allergic reaction occurs
discontinue use and seek medical attention. If the product comes into contact with
the eyes, rinse thoroughly with fresh water and consult a physician. It should not be
used with patients who have a history of severe allergic reaction to any of the
components.</p>
